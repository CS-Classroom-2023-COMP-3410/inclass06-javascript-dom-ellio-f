Game Logic:

- after a card is clicked, add it to a 'currentPair' variable
- when the pair contains two cards, check if they're equal
    - if yes, disable the onClick() for those cards
            add 1 to the score
            if all cards are face up, then we win
    - if no, flip them back over
            remove them from the currentPair
